    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "ExxonMobil’s forward trading profile indicates a valuation premium to the integrated oil & gas peer median on **EV/EBITDA** and **P/E**, while its **FCF Yield is meaningfully lower**. This setup suggests that public markets are assigning ExxonMobil a **higher-quality, lower-risk cash-flow profile** and are willing to pay more for its earnings and EBITDA stream relative to peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this premium stands in tension with our DCF-based intrinsic value estimate, which prices ExxonMobil below its current spot price. Unless Exxon can deliver:\n",
    "\n",
    "- structurally higher free cash flows,\n",
    "- sustained capital-return outperformance, or\n",
    "- continued margin resilience above the cycle,\n",
    "\n",
    "the current valuation implies that **optimism is already priced in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Premium multiples** → markets expect stronger growth and durability  \n",
